gala - Genetic Algorithm for Lattice Antenna
=

generates a set of random antenna, calculates their electron output, evolves them

I tried using a non-negative least squares solver in C (TSNNLS) but it
refused to solve even for a reasonable antenna configuration, so for now
I'm just using scipy's nnls solver. There's also a Julia version and/or
the original fortran code from Lawson and Hanson if it needs speeding up
in the future
