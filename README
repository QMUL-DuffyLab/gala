gala - Genetic Algorithm for Lattice Antenna
=

generates a set of random antenna, calculates their electron output, evolves them

currently uses TSNNLS in C to solve the set of equations governing occupation
probabilities; this was a bit of a nightmare.
For reference, I got TSNNLS from 
`https://jasoncantarella.com/downloads/libtsnnls2.3.4.tar.gz`
first, then `sudo ./configure && make && make install` should work.
It worked fine on Ubuntu in WSL but did not work at all in Fedora;
for Fedora I ended up installing OpenBLAS in a separate directory,
(`https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS`),
pointing TSNNLS to that BLAS instead, and then I still had to go into
one of the header files and rename a couple of typedef'd integers
because it was adamant it couldn't find a 32-bit integer type anywhere.
Adding `#include <stdint.h>` and typedef'ing the types it wanted to
`int32_t, uint32_t` fixed it and it compiled fine. Note that if you
need to do this you'll probably also have to update `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
accordingly before it'll actually run.
